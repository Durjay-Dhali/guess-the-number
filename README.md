# Guess the Number Game

A simple text-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## Instructions

1. Open the `guess-the-number.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field.
3. Click the "Submit" button to make a guess.
4. The game will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Keep guessing until you find the secret number!

## How it Works

The game is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the code:

- When the page is loaded, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated and stored as the secret number.
- The player enters a guess in the input field and clicks the "Submit" button.
- The guess is compared with the secret number, and the game provides feedback.
- If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the input is disabled.
- Invalid inputs (non-numeric values or numbers outside the valid range) are handled with appropriate error messages.
- The number of guesses made by the player is tracked and displayed with the final result.

Feel free to modify and enhance the game according to your preferences!
